Problem Assignment 2 --- R Programming | Coursera

This is my solution to the second programming assignment of the R programming course on coursera.

The code is to be found within the "cache_inverse.R" file. The last rows in the code file may be used to quickly generate two matrices in order to test the two functions.

Greetings!
